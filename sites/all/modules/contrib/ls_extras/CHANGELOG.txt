To release as 1.8.

LS Node Titles:
* Changed: Check body first, then if teaser is separate (not in body) check there too. 
  More efficient as saves a wasted call to ls_titles process in typical cases.
  Also, checking the teaser when it's just a trimmed version of the body could break LS logic maybe.
* Changed $processed to single value instead of array - will save memory on pages which display many nodes.

LS Titles:
* Fixed: Use language_sections_format_check($format), not $node->format.

LS Titles:
* Removed 'count' debug lines.
* Do language_sections_format_check($format) before further processing.
* Use current $id if $active - avoids repeated md5 calculation.
* Changed to add space instead of \n to for forcing separate caching of title since that is less likely to affect display.
* Clear static cache after miss to prevent using up memory (e.g. front page or display of nodes with lots of comments.)

LS Node Titles:
* Added $processed[$node->nid] prevent unnecessary node_load() etc during 'prepare'.
* Removed $disabled flag, now handled with $processed[].
* Changed to pass $node-nid to ls_titles_process for use as id.

LS View Titles:
* Check: isset($display_options) before further processing.
* Remove language_sections_format_check() as it's now done in LS Titles.

LS Block Titles:
* Remove language_sections_format_check() as it's now done in LS Titles.
* Use block_box_get() instead of query to fetch block data for better compatibility with possible future Drupal changes.
